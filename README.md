## Background and Motivation

Silvercar is a rental car startup that aspires to take the pain out of the rental car process, so they have a number of different user-friendly policies:

- Users aren't charged for cancellations and no-shows
- Users don't have to create a Silvercar account to reserve a car
- Users don't have to enter credit card information to reserve a car

These policies give customers a lot of flexibility, but they create a business problem because roughly 41% of their reservations aren't completed.


## Objective

I set out to create a model that can predict the reservations that will be cancelled to help Silvercar:
- Better manage their fleet of cars at each location
- Improve short-term revenue forecasting
- Potentially identify opportunities to prevent cancellations


## MOEs (Measures of Effectiveness)

I chose accuracy as the reporting MOE for my model's performance because the classes are reasonably balanced (59% finished and 41% cancelled), and it's interpretable. I also used the F1 score to evaluate my models and choose a decision threshold, but I didn't want to look at the F1 score in a vacuum because the two components of F1, precision and recall, are both important for accomplishing my first two objectives.

In this case, precision is the number of correctly identified cancellations divided by the number of predicted cancellations. This is an important metric for fleet management because the number of incorrectly labeled cancellations need to be minimized. If too many rides are incorrectly predicted to be cancelled, then the model would be informing Silvercar that they don't need as many cars available as they actually do.

Recall is the number of correctly identified cancellations divided by the number of actual cancellations. If recall is too low (i.e. the model isn't predicting enough cancellations), then the second objective won't be accomplished because revenue will be overstated.


## MOPs (Measures of Performance)

The main **reservations** table has roughly 460,000 rows, so I didn't have to worry about memory, disk space, or training time. All of the data can be stored on a single machine, and all of it can be loaded into a single machine's memory. Every night Silvercar could easily train the model on all of the historical reservations and make predictions on the outstanding booked reservations.


## Results

Using a 50% threshold for predicting cancellations (i.e. a cancellation is predicted when the cancellation probability is greater than 50%), I achieved 80% accuracy, 72% F1, 84% precision, and 63% recall using XGBoost's implementation of a gradient boosting classifier. As you can see in figure 1, the model is predicting significantly less cancellations than there actually were, which is why recall is only 63%. This is problematic for revenue forecasting.

I lowered the same model's threshold to 40%, which resulted in 79% accuracy, 73% F1, 75% precision, and 72% recall. This threshold gives a more even distribution of inaccurate predictions. Silvercar could take these predictions and make more conservative estimates to calculate their revenue forecasts and determine the number of cars needed at each location. I think coupling these predictions with historical data will prove to be more effective rather than solely basing their projections on historical data.

As for opportunities to prevent cancellations, figure 4 below illustrates the most important features according to the final model.<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> Unsurprisingly most of the features are out of Silvercar's control, but promotions could be useful because users are less likely to cancel when applying promo codes to their reservations. We would need to conduct cost-benefit analysis, but offering promotions to
users that are more likely to cancel could yield positive results.

Silvercar tries to bother its customers as little as possible, but they could start to send their customers email reminders for upcoming trips that ask the customers to confirm or cancel their reservation. This wouldn't necessarily reduce cancellations, but it could complement the model well. Silvercar would have more notice of the cancellations, and they wouldn't need to rely on the model for as many predictions.

Silvercar could also start to send out cancellation surveys, so they could segment the cancellations based off of the various cancellation reasons.

## Web Application

I made a prototype of a dashboard that can be used to monitor the expected number of cancellations for each of Silvercar's locations. The new reservation page allows users to change different reservation features to see how it affects the cancellation probability. Try it out here:

## Footnotes

<a name="footnote1">1</a>. Gradient boosting classifiers, like other tree-based ensembles, have misleading feature importances when categorical and numerical features are mixed. The numerical features are weighted more heavily because they are continuous, so there are more opportunities for the decision trees to split on them. For categorical features, there are only a handful of possible splits (only 1 for binary features), so feature importances have to be evaluated separately for the numerical and categorical features.
